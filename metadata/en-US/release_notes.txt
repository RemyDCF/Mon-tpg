* New design, new icon *
In this version, tpg offline has a brand new design, with an icon refreshed for more autumnal colors.
In addition, the application has much sharper contrasts, which will allow much better readability.

* iPhone X *
Do you like the black bars of a non-optimized application on your brand new iPhone X? We neither. That's why this new version is optimized for iPhone X.

* Speed, lightness, stability *
The application has been completely rewritten for this version. Yes, everything. Starting on new and more stable bases, many dependencies have been removed to allow a much better stability, a lighter app and especially much faster app to start and use.

* End of the road for iOS 9 *
We apologize to the users of iPhone 4S, iPad 2 and 3, iPad mini 1 and iPod touch 5G, but this version is not compatible with iOS 9. In the meantime, you can still use version 12.

* Apple Watch *
Do you have an Apple Watch? Now, your companion to your iPhone will give you the departures of all stops, disruptions on the tpg network and your favorite routes.

* Translations *
Now, in addition to being Open Source, tpg offline now has a collaborative translation site. If you speak German, Italian, Spanish or even Japanese, you can participate in the translation of the application. Feel free to take a tour on https://www.transifex.com/remydcf/tpg-offline/.
